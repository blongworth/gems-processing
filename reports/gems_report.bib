              The eddy covariance ({EC}) technique is a powerful tool for measuring atmospheric exchange rates that was recently adapted by biogeochemists to measure aquatic oxygen fluxes. A review of aquatic biogeochemical {EC} literature revealed that the majority of studies were conducted in shallow waters where waves were likely present, and that waves biased sensor and turbulence measurements. This review identified that larger measurement heights shifted turbulence to lower frequencies, producing a spectral gap between turbulence and wave frequencies. However, some studies sampled too close to the boundary to allow for a spectral turbulence‐wave gap, and a change in how {EC} measurements are conducted and analyzed is needed to remove wave‐bias. {EC} fluxes have only been derived from the time‐averaged product of vertical velocity and oxygen, often resulting in wave‐bias. Presented is a new analysis framework for removing wave‐bias by accumulation of cross‐power spectral densities below wave frequencies. This analysis framework also includes new measurement guidelines based on wave period, currents, and measurement heights. This framework is applied to sand, seagrass, and reef environments where traditional {EC} analysis resulted in wave‐bias of 7.0\% ± 9.2\% error in biogeochemical (oxygen and H
              +
              ) fluxes, while more variable and higher error was evident in momentum fluxes (10.5\% ± 21.0\% error). It is anticipated that this framework will lead to significant changes in how {EC} measurements are conducted and evaluated, and help overcome the major limitations caused by wave‐sensitive and slow‐response sensors, potentially expanding new chemical tracer applications and more widespread use of the {EC} technique.

            Plain Language Summary
            Biogeochemical processes can be estimated by the exchange of vital tracers between the seafloor, overlying water, and the atmosphere and are paramount to understanding global biogeochemical cycling. Techniques that measure water transport and tracers of these processes (here oxygen and {pH}) have revolutionized how these exchanges are studied, and how they impact local water quality, productivity, and nutrient cycling. Through measurements of oxygen concentration and {pH}, and their transport by water movement, their exchange can be determined. These techniques were originally developed to examine exchange between the land and atmosphere, but applying these techniques to aquatic ecosystems has presented challenges due to surface waves that are present in the shallow aquatic ecosystems where these aquatic techniques are commonly applied. Waves cause errors in the sensors used to measure water transport and tracer concentrations, and have presented significant challenges for applying these atmospheric techniques underwater. This research presents new guidelines for these aquatic exchange measurements that will require a change in how measurements are conducted and analyzed, to allow for tracer exchange measurements in the presence of waves. These new guidelines also allow for new sensors that were previously incompatible, expanding the applications of these techniques to new scientific research questions.

            Multiple methods exist to measure the benthic flux of dissolved oxygen ({DO}), but many are limited by short deployments and provide only a snapshot of the processes occurring at the sediment–water interface. The gradient flux ({GF}) method measures near bed gradients of {DO} and estimates the eddy diffusivity from existing turbulence closure methods to solve for the benthic flux. This study compares measurements at a seagrass, reef, and sand environment with measurements from two other methods, eddy covariance and benthic chambers, to highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and uncertainty of measurements being made. The results show three major areas of primary importance when using the {GF} method: (1) a sufficient {DO} gradient is critical to use this method and is limited by the {DO} sensor precision and gradient variability; (2) it is important to use similar methods when comparing across sites or time, as many of the methods showed good agreement but were often biased larger or smaller based on the method; and (3) in complex bottom types, estimates of the length scale and placement of the {DO} sensors can lead to large sources of error. Careful consideration of these potential errors is needed when using the {GF} method, but when properly addressed, this method showed high agreement with the other methods and may prove a useful tool for measuring long‐term benthic fluxes of {DO} or other chemical sensors or constituents of interest that are incompatible with other methods.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal vents along mid-ocean systems host unique, highly productive biological communities, based on microbial chemoautotrophy, that thrive on the sulphur, metals, nitrogen and carbon emitted from the vents into the deep ocean. Geochemical studies of vents have centred on analyses of high-temperature, focused hydrothermal vents, which exhibit very high flow rates and are generally considered too hot for microbial life. Geochemical fluxes and metabolic activity associated with habitable, lower temperature diffuse fluids remain poorly constrained. As a result, little is known about the extent to which microbial communities, particularly in the subsurface, influence geochemical flux from more diffuse flows. Here, we estimate the net flux of methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen from diffuse and focused hydrothermal vents along the Juan de Fuca ridge, using an in situ mass spectrometer and flowmeter. We show that geochemical flux from diffuse vents can equal or exceed that emanating from hot, focused vents. Notably, hydrogen concentrations in fluids emerging from diffuse vents are 50\% to 80\% lower than predicted. We attribute the loss of hydrogen in diffuse vent fluids to microbial consumption in the subsurface, and suggest that subsurface microbial communities can significantly influence hydrothermal geochemical fluxes to the deep ocean.},

              Coral reefs are threatened worldwide, and there is a need to develop new approaches to monitor reef health under natural conditions. Because simultaneous measurements of net community production ({NCP}) and net community calcification ({NCC}) are used as important indicators of reef health, tools are needed to assess them in situ. Here we present the Benthic Ecosystem and Acidification Measurement System ({BEAMS}) to provide the first fully autonomous approach capable of sustained, simultaneous measurements of reef {NCP} and {NCC} under undisturbed, natural conditions on time scales ranging from tens of minutes to weeks. {BEAMS} combines the chemical and velocity gradient in the benthic boundary layer to quantify flux from the benthos for a variety of parameters to measure {NCP} and {NCC}. Here {BEAMS} was used to measure these rates from two different sites with different benthic communities on the western reef terrace at Palmyra Atoll for 2 weeks in September 2014. Measurements were made every ∼15 min. The trends in metabolic rates were consistent with the benthic communities between the two sites with one dominated by fleshy organisms and the other dominated by calcifiers (degraded and healthy reefs, respectively). This demonstrates the potential utility of {BEAMS} as a reef health monitoring tool. {NCP} and {NCC} were tightly coupled on time scales of minutes to days, and light was the primary driver for the variability of daily integrated metabolic rates. No correlation between {CO}

              levels and daily integrated {NCC} was observed, indicating that {NCC} at these sites were not significantly affected by {CO}
